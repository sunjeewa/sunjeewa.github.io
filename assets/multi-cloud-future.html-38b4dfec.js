This approach allows organizations to take advantage of the best features and services offered by each individual provider, rather than being limited by the offerings of a single provider.",-1),r=e("p",null,"One of the primary drivers behind the shift towards a multi-cloud world is the increasing number of cloud providers and the diverse range of services they offer. In the past, businesses had to choose between a few major players in the cloud market, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Today, there are many more options to choose from, including smaller, specialized providers that offer niche services.
